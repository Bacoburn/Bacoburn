# Hello there!
I'm Ron Pham, currently a sophomore studying Computer Science and Mathematics at University of Illinois at Chicago. Currently, I'm interested in learning computer systems, cybersecurity, cryptography and advanced mathematics while working to create some fascinating projects.

## A bit about my life
The potential power of computing that a single computer could achieve has always intrigued my curious mind. I used to spend most of my free time going behind the scenes of simple programs and learning about how the computer translates the code into the assembly and executes it, as well as the intricacies of compilers and how different hardware components of a computer work on an architectural level. 

## What I've coded in the past
- A basic messaging app in Java
- A blackjack and a battleship game in Java
- An optimized wayfinder program of my uni campus in C++

## What I'm currently doing
- Creating my own kernel
- Some game/app in assembly
- A bitcoin miner
